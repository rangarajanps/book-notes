**Introduction**

Xeerox PARC - Alto, a personal computer, 1979

If this anecdote leaves you conflicted about Jobs and Gates, a little context should help. A few facts are worth noting. First, Xerox had no intention of selling inexpensive computers to a mass market. The reason most people have never heard of the Alto isn’t because Jobs stole the idea—it’s because Xerox failed to recognize their technology’s potential. Second, Microsoft was working on a graphic user interface before Gates saw the Macintosh. Jobs didn’t know it but Gates was equally enamored with Xerox’s computers. Finally, neither Jobs nor Gates wanted to simply replicate Xerox’s technology. They sought to improve upon it in unique ways. Apple aimed to make computers user friendly. Microsoft prioritized making computers affordable. Both companies identified an underutilized idea and worked to make it better.


**The Mastery Detectives**

Greatness comes from Talent, Practice. 3rd dimension is reverse engineering. To reverse engineer is to look beyond what is evident on the surface and find a hidden structure—one that reveals both how an object was designed and, more important, how it can be re-created. It’s the ability to taste an intoxicating dish and deduce its recipe, to listen to a beautiful song and discern its chord progression.

CopyWork is one approach to understand how the song/script was written.

Kurt Vonnegut believed that the world’s most popular stories—including those featured in the Bible, literary classics, and blockbuster films—fit neatly into one of six trajectories:

1. Rags to Riches (a rising emotional arc)
2. Riches to Rags (a falling emotional arc)
3. Man in a Hole (a fall followed by a rise)
4. Icarus (a rise followed by a fall)
5. Cinderella (rise, fall, rise)
6. Oedipus (fall, rise, fall)

**Photography**

When most people look at a photo, they focus on objects. Professionals direct their attention to something entirely different: the shadows. Years of experience have taught them to scan images for clues revealing how they were constructed. The length and direction of shadows are telling: they suggest camera angle, time of day, and lens aperture. Then there’s the richness and intensity of the shadows. Sharp, defined edges suggest a hard light source, while diffuse shading indicates softer lighting.

And that’s just the beginning. Seasoned photographers also search for reflections, such as those that often appear in a subject’s eyes, to determine where the light source was placed. They can also approximate camera lens by the level of distortion and contrast between a photo’s foreground and background. All that before an image is imported into Photoshop for a more detailed, computer-assisted analysis.

**Decoding Deliciousness**

Chef David Chang - Contrast with ingredients

When you eat something amazing, you don't just respond to the dish in front of you, you are almost always transported back to another moment in your life... 

**How to reverse engineer a Billion Dollar Franchise**

Many evaluate a start-up based on idea's originality, novelty. Experienced business owners focus on customer demand, the logistics of production and deliverability, and projected cash flow. 

Chef Steve Ells - Chipotle - Introduce a proven product into a new market. He took his idea for a streamlined Mexican restaurant to a place where tacos were relatively rare: Denver

1980, Howard Schultz visited Milan and encountered espresso bars. When he returned to Seatle, Starbucks had no interest in this idea. He resigned and started his own chain - Il Giornale. A few years later, when Schultz’s old employer was ready to sell its coffee bean business, Schultz had enough money in the bank to pounce. He merged the two businesses under the original Starbucks name.

**The Secret Lives of Weapons, Drugs, and Race Cars**

The Soviets had nuclear weapons in their arsenal but lacked the required delivery mechanism to make them much of a threat.

Three short years after a B-29 made an emergency landing in a Russsian City Vladivostok, the Soviets debuted a long-range bomber at their annual military airshow. They called it the Tu-4. It was indistinguishable from the B-29 in virtually every way except its name.

Founded in 1997 by a pair of car-obsessed brothers, A2Mac1 dismantles cars full-time and sells its reports as a subscription service.

**The Wrong Way to Think About Creativity**

Creative professionals are rightly sensitive to accusations of imitation and plagiarism

First, creativity comes from blending ideas, not isolation. When we’re exposed to new ideas and fresh perspectives, we are at our most generative. This is why one of the best predictors of creativity is openness to experience. 

Second, originality is not the same thing as creativity. Often, those who introduce new concepts are locked into certain ways of thinking, preventing them from identifying important and novel applications for their “original” ideas. The business world is bursting with examples of “first movers” being outmaneuvered by scrappier, more creative rivals. As the creators of the PalmPilot, Atari, Alta Vista, Friendster, and America Online will all readily admit: being first is not the same as being best.

Finally, far from short-circuiting our creativity, reverse engineering enables us to acquire new skills, which empower us to be generative in entirely new ways. And that’s important, especially given the speed with which most industries are now evolving.

Simply put: the alternative to reverse engineering isn’t originality. It’s operating with intellectual blinders.

To be sure, there are those who abuse the methodologies described in this book. There are companies whose entire business model consists of duplicating winning products and selling them to customers at a lower price, and there are countries that show little regard for the intellectual property of those living outside their borders.

But to focus on them would be missing the point. Because the existence of parasitic copycats does not negate the educational value of reverse engineering any more than a serial killer negates the value of a table knife.

Most professionals are not interested in copying existing products. They’re after something far more crucial and valuable: a proven recipe that can be applied in a fresh context and leveraged in novel ways.

**How Copying Makes You More Original**

In 2017, Takeshi Okada and Kentaro Ishibashi, creativity experts at the University of Tokyo, published a paper in Cognitive Science. 2 groups - practice new drawings on their own, another copying famous work. 

Now, let’s pause here and acknowledge the obvious: the idea that copying an existing work leads to more creativity is wildly counterintuitive. After all, isn’t copying the very antithesis of originality? How, then, do the researchers account for this finding?

By differentiating between the act of copying and the work it subsequently inspires. In the short term, replicating a work won’t result in creativity. It’s afterward that the real magic happens.

The process of copying—of carefully analyzing a particular work, deconstructing its key components, and rebuilding it anew—is a transformative mental exercise that does wonders for our thinking.

Copying demands that we pay meticulous attention, prompting us to reflect on both subtle details and unexpected techniques. But it’s more than just heightened scrutiny. Copying also forces us to contemplate the decisions an artist made and sensitizes us to opportunities we typically overlook. In so doing, copying challenges our default approach. It opens us up to novel ways of thinking, prompting us to find creative opportunities buried within our own work. In contrast, looking inward for creative ideas rarely gets us very far.

There is a price to working in isolation. Invariably, we find ourselves considering fewer options, recycling the same tired ideas again and again, or falling back on familiar solutions that have worked in the past.

It gets worse. Over time, we fall prey to unspoken assumptions about what a good solution looks like, which further limits our thinking. And the longer we spend turning over a problem in our head, the less likely we are to stumble upon a truly innovative idea.

Far from making us unoriginal, copying breaks the spell. It challenges our assumptions, relaxes our cognitive constraints, and opens us up to new perspectives. No, deconstructing works we admire doesn’t weaken our creativity or lead us to produce derivative work. On the contrary: it’s an essential tool for breaking down the hidden barriers that keep us stuck.

So how do you do it? How do you take apart work you admire—from your favorite podcast to a competitor’s website to an Academy Award–winning film—enabling you to extract its formula and unleash your own creative juices? Is there a reliable road map for deconstructing works we wish to emulate?
And perhaps the bigger question is this[…]
