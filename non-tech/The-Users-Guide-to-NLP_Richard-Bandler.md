**Day 1 - How to change Negative thinking**

**Understanding Personal freedom**

Personal freedom is the ability to feel what you. want so that the chains of fear, sadness and hate are broken. These chains are made of negative feelings, limiting beliefs and destructive behaviour.

Many people feel trapped by the past, but they aren't really trapped. They're just practising a habit of feeling bad.

A lot of people have had bad things happen to them, so instead of being glad that it's not happening now they go through it over and over in their heads, so that their present is destroyed by their past.

We always have the choice of taking our past and building a better future or taking our past and limiting our future.

Poeple just have different ways of thinking, some of them helping them and some of them hurting them.

Anybody who goes inside themselves and makes their life more miserable than it needs to be is an example of someone who chains themselves to the belief that life is suffering.

They forget that life is not about remembering and reliving unpleasantness from their past but about going forward to look at life as the adventure it can be.

They're supposed to ask themselves more challenging questions, such as: 'How can I enjoy myself? How can I make this easier? How can I make this fun?'

Personal freedom is also about being able to take the good internal states and the things that you want and being able to manifest them in your life. Freedom enables you to find things like love, success, music and art.
