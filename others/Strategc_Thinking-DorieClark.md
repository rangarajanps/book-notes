Delibrate practice - Anders Ericsson of 10,000 hours fame.  Likewise, we can learn to make better decisions and develop sharper strategies if we review our assumptions, check them against those milestones and see what we got right and wrong. That enables us to see where we're overconfident and where we've historically had blind spots. 

**Strategic thinking is an ongoing process**

* Audit the process and progress 
	* Are you failing to meet the initial expectations?
	* Has there been any change in circumstances
	* Is there a more promising alternative?
* Redo the strategy only when there is a significant, more probability of growth  
* When considering a change, run a small test, consult colleagues and advisors  

**Limits of strategy**

"Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth." - Mike Tyson

when something truly unexpected happens, strategy has it's limits. You didn't plan for this. So what do you do? That's where the real value of strategic thinking lies because it's not just about a fixed plan, it's the ability to think in a strategic way that adapts to changing circumstances.  
1. **Accept and move on** - People often make the mistake of clinging to past assumptions. The best thing you can do when there's been a disruption is take an honest look at the circumstances around you. And if your expectations have blown up, admit that, so you can quickly move to formulating a new plan. You don't want to be fixated on past predictions so much that you can't take new data into account.  
2. **Respond decisively** This goes with the first point about clinging to past assumptions. The very dangerous corollary to that is that you're dragging your feet on making needed changes. Of course you want to gather all the facts and see if your information is correct, but if it is, move as swiftly as you can, and don't let the situation worsen in front of your eyes.  
3. Third and finally, you'll have to **embrace improvisation**. It may seem like the opposite of strategy, which is planned out and finally rot, but improvisation doesn't mean coming up with something, anything, and flailing around, it means going back to first principles. In this case, the vision for your organization or your team or yourself and recognizing that if the current strategy no longer works, you can devise another one that will still help you get to your vision.  

If you want to be a leader that makes people's lives better but the program you were working on just got shut down, look around and scan the horizon for other parts of the company that are focused on meaningful initiatives. You look for another path to accomplish your vision. Sometimes strategic thinking means recognizing the limits of a given strategy and being willing to come up with something new. It's another, perhaps better route to your destination.
